## About Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital asset that is not controlled by governments or financial institutions. At the same time, it also serves as a unique payment system, with transactions verified through a network of nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain. The Bitcoin economic system consists of numerous computers distributed globally, and anyone can participate by downloading the open-source Bitcoin software.&#x20;

The primary characteristics of blockchain include decentralization, transparency, and divisibility. As a pioneer of blockchain technology, Bitcoin has consistently held a leading position.

## What are Bitcoin Layer 2sï¼Ÿ

Although Bitcoin has been successful, the design of its native network has limited the development of the Bitcoin ecosystem, including issues such as slow transaction speeds, high transaction fees, and scalability. The community generally believes that the introduction of the Bitcoin Layers is needed to address these issues.&#x20;

While it is undeniable that Bitcoin remains the most decentralized, secure, and enduring blockchain, layer 2 solutions significantly contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem by addressing scalability and transaction speed issues. They expand Bitcoin's utility beyond a store of value to a more versatile, functional cryptocurrency capable of supporting complex applications and systems. Bitcoin layer 2s will further expand its applications, ecological development, and explore new possibilities within the Bitcoin universe.

## About NetBit Chain

NetBit Chain is an innovative public chain based on the Bitcoin blockchain, aiming to enhance the capabilities of Bitcoin by integrating smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized applications (dApps). By introducing additional protocols and layers, it provides a faster, more economical, and more scalable transaction method, while protecting user privacy and adding more features, making Bitcoin more suitable for various application scenarios.&#x20;

At the core of the NetBit blockchain is its native cryptocurrency, the NBTC token, utilized for executing smart contracts and processing transactions. NetBit introduces novel features for independent validation, ensuring security linked to the Bitcoin blockchain, and the Clarity programming language, enhancing smart contract security and transparency. NetBit's tokenomics are closely intertwined with Bitcoin, fostering network consensus and security through token locking mechanisms and offering Bitcoin rewards for participants.

During the initial stages of NetBit's development, NetBit Chain will launch NetBit Launchpad and Launchpool, aiming to provide a swift and effective way for new projects to raise funds. This offers users with the opportunity to participate in new projects in the NetBit ecosystem, with users be rewarded for providing funding support or liquidity.&#x20;

NetBit will also fully integrate the Ordinals and Runes protocols, combining runes with ordinal collections to expand the functionality of runes and enhance the interaction of collections. This integration will open up new possibilities for runes to empower collections and contribute to building a diversified Bitcoin ecosystem. Additionally, NetBit will launch an efficient and automated SWAP platform to provide users with transparent and decentralized BTC trading services.

NetBit Chain continues its commitment to fair deployment and community-driven native innovation on Layer 2, striving to provide unique solutions designed for the Bitcoin network and its users.
