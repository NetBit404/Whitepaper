# NetBit Launchpad

NetBit Launchpad is the inaugural issuance platform of NetBit, designed to provide a swift and effective way for new projects to raise funds. Through the launchpad, users can have the opportunity to participate in the public issuance phase of new projects within the NetBit Chain ecosystem and receive corresponding rewards after the project is launched.&#x20;

Currently, tokens are issued through inscription on the Bitcoin, which ensured fairness as both deployers and participants had to pay on-chain gas fees for successful inscription. In other words, both parties invest equal costs and time into the process. However, there are also problems with this traditional inscription method. Deployers can't raise funds for the subsequent development of the project through inscriptions, so most inscriptions issued on the market lack sustainability. This also leads to low liquidity in the entire inscription market and fails to attract more users to join.&#x20;

The launch of NetBit Launchpad will bring about a significant paradigm shift that will benefit both deployers and participants. Through NetBit Launchpad, deployers can raise funds from the market, which can be used for project promotion and development. Users can also support and participate in these projects in a more direct and sustainable way.
