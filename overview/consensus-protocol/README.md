## Introduction

NetBit Chain is an innovative Bitcoin Layer 2 aimed at inheriting the advanced security of the Bitcoin network while expanding its functionality to unlock more verticals. Through continuous innovation and optimization, NetBit Chain will become the engine for the next phase of growth for Bitcoin Layer 2, bringing more opportunities and experiences to users. Here's how NetBit Chain optimizes and expands Bitcoin Layer 2:

* Inheriting Bitcoin Network's Advanced Security: NetBit Chain will continue to rely on the security of the Bitcoin network, ensuring the security and stability of the base layer remain unaffected.&#x20;
* Expanding Capabilities to Bitcoin: Unlocking new utilities on other verticals. NetBit will also fully integrate the Ordinals and Runes protocols, establishing the innovative BRC-404 protocol that combines runes with ordinal sets to expand the functionality of runes and enhance interaction within sets. NetBit will support more NFT applications such as digital artworks, gaming assets, collectibles, etc., providing users with a richer experience in digital asset trading.
* Enhanced Programmability: Introducing complex smart contract functionalities enables developers to build more diverse and sophisticated decentralized applications on NetBit Chain, providing users with richer services and experiences.
* Improving Scalability: By introducing POET to optimize network structure and protocol design, NetBit Chain will improve transaction throughput, support more concurrent transactions, and enhance the overall network performance. Introducing faster block confirmation times will accelerate transaction processing speeds and improve user experience. By reducing transaction costs, small-value transactions become more practical, fostering wider adoption of the network.

## Smart Contracts on NetBit

NetBit leverages Clarity and other innovative technologies to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for building decentralized applications and interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain. NetBit utilizes Clarity, a highly secure programming language, for its main layer. Clarity stands out for its decidability, meaning that the behavior of a program can be determined directly from the code itself, offering unparalleled transparency and software-verified correctness. As an interpreted language, Clarity ensures that smart contract source code remains visible on the blockchain, allowing for human verification, while its post-conditions provide additional execution safety.

Developers leveraging the NetBit layer can create a wide range of applications similar to those found on other smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. However, they have the distinct advantage of utilizing Bitcoin (BTC) as their asset and settling transactions directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This can be achieved using Clarity on the Clarity VM or, through subnets, developers can also code in Solidity or other languages on the EVM or other virtual machines. Furthermore, users can seamlessly swap BTC for assets like stablecoins and NFTs directly from the Bitcoin chain.

In addition to its compatibility with various smart contract platforms, NetBit offers several enhancements and features:&#x20;

* Higher Performance: NetBit's layer provides improved performance compared to traditional smart contract platforms.&#x20;
* Native Token Support: Having a native token on NetBit actually benefits Bitcoin, rather than detracting from it.&#x20;
* Decentralized Two-Way Bitcoin Peg: NetBit features a decentralized two-way Bitcoin peg, ensuring seamless interaction between the Bitcoin blockchain and the NetBit chain.&#x20;
* Additional Capabilities: NetBit will offer capabilities for performance and versatility in the future, including subnets, future EVM compatibility, and the potential for ZK-rollups.
