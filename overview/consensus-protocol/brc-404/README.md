# BRC-404

BRC-404 represents an unprecedented experimental venture on Bitcoin, delving into the realms of uncharted territories. Through recursive definitions, it pioneers the creation of more intricate asset formats, ranging from game items and animations to effects, and even game modules within the Metaverse. In the future, NetBit will showcase a variety of inscription formats, including 2D, 3D, and more, ensuring broad compatibility with numerous gaming platforms and engines.

Additionally, BRC-404 will empower ordinals collections with runes, significantly expanding the functionality of runes and facilitating enhanced interactions within the collections. This integration opens up new avenues for Inscriptions, empowering runes with the potential to serve as the backbone of unique collections. Furthermore, it creates a symbiotic relationship between usage rights and runes. When you own runes, you can purchase items to build the inscriptions that you have usage rights for.

By paving the way for Ordinalsâ€™ on-chain gaming and modular blockchains, BRC-404 opens up endless possibilities. Diverse creators can contribute distinct modules, each earning rewards commensurate with their contributions. This surge of innovation within the Ordinals ecosystem benefits all participants, creating a collaborative environment where creativity flourishes and everyone reaps the rewards.
