## About Columbus Rune

Runes according to runestones come into existence by being etched. Etching creates a rune and sets its properties. Once set, these properties are immutable, even to its etcher. Whereas every inscription is unique, every unit of a rune is the same. They are interchangeable tokens, fit for a variety of purposes. Runes allow Bitcoin transactions to etch, mint, and transfer Bitcoin-native digital commodities.
