* _**Registration Airdrop:**_ In the initial stage of NetBit, new users will receive a one-time airdrop of 1 NBTC after completing registration.

**NOTE:** In order to better meet the needs of more users and maintain balance, NetBit will dynamically adjust the quantity of registered airdrops based on the number of active users. This mechanism can also more accurately reflect user participation and the development of the platform.

* _**Mining Airdrop:**_ Users receive mining airdrops for participating in mining every day. NetBit will release _**5,000**_ NBTC as mining airdrops every day.

* _**Task Airdrop:**_ Users can choose to complete different tasks to earn additional task airdrops. Users will receive an airdrop bonus for each completed task.
